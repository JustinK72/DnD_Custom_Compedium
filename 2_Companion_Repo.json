When a creature provokes an Opportunity Attack from you by leaving your reach, you can take a Reaction to cast a spell at the creature rather than making an Opportunity Attack. The spell must have a casting time of one action and must target only that creature.\nSomatic Components. You can perform the Somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a Shield in one or both hands.\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook (2024) p. 209",

Beyond these commonalities, boggart appearances vary widely. One boggart may look like a hedgehog, with spiky fur and beady eyes, while another might sport the snout and fleshy ears of a swine. Boggarts tend to love crafting potions and commonly gravitate to specific areas of expertise, as noted in the sections below.\nIn Lorwyn:\nBoggarts in Lorwyn are born into communal warrens where laws and hierarchies are considered suggestions. The oldest and most powerful boggarts, known as \"aunties,\" serve as respected leaders who keep the peace. Lorwyn boggarts value sharing knowledge and past experiences with their communities. Many are willing to brave great dangers in pursuit of new experiences, and adventurers are common.\n\tLorwyn boggarts also have a knack for magic. Boggarts who feel drawn to learning and using these natural affinities often become Druids. A Lorwyn boggart might alternatively find a calling as a Ranger, especially the Fey Wanderer subclass, or as a Wizard, especially the Diviner subclass, as boggarts have proven fond of ascertaining information through divination magic.\nIn Shadowmoor:\nBoggarts in Shadowmoor generally have sharper physical features than Lorwyn boggarts, including additional sets of horns. They are also known for body modifications, such as riveting armored plates to their flesh. Shadowmoor boggart society is chaotic and decentralized; their communities are few and likely to be found in isolated or dangerous environments. Aunties in Shadowmoor wander the lands, greeting those they meet with arbitrary tests, boons, or even curses.\n\tLike their Lorwyn counterparts, Shadowmoor boggarts are drawn to magic. These boggarts might become Warlocks, particularly leaning toward the Archfey Patron subclass; some might believe their patron is Isilu. Others prove to be Sorcerers and are especially likely to manifest their power in the form of the Wild Magic Sorcery subclass.\nSource:\tLorwyn: First Light"

Called by various names on different worlds -Moradin, Reorx, and others- that god gave dwarves an affinity for stone and metal and for living underground. The god also made them resilient like the mountains, with a life span of about 350 years.\n\tSquat and often bearded, the original dwarves carved cities and strongholds into mountainsides and under the earth. Their oldest legends tell of conflicts with the monsters of mountaintops and the Underdark, whether those monsters were towering giants or subterranean horrors. Inspired by those tales, dwarves of any culture often sing of valorous deeds-especially of the little overcoming the mighty.\n\tOn some worlds in the multiverse, the first settlements of dwarves were built in hills or mountains, and the families who trace their ancestry to those settlements call themselves hill dwarves or mountain dwarves, respectively. The Greyhawk and Dragonlance settings have such communities.\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook (2024) p. 188"

That said, many halflings possess a brave and adventurous spirit that leads them on journeys of discovery, affording them the chance to explore a bigger world and make new friends along the way. Their size -similar to that of a human child- helps them pass through crowds unnoticed and slip through tight spaces.\n\tAnyone who has spent time around halflings, particularly halfling adventurers, has likely witnessed the storied \"luck of the halflings\" in action. When a halfling is in mortal danger, an unseen force seems to intervene on the halfling's behalf. Many halflings believe in the power of luck, and they attribute their unusual gift to one or more of their benevolent gods, including Yondalla, Brandobaris, and Charmalaine. The same gift might contribute to their robust life spans (about 150 years).\n\tHalfling communities come in all varieties. For every sequestered shire tucked away in an unspoiled part of the world, there's a crime syndicate like the Boromar Clan in the Eberron setting or a territorial mob of halflings like those in the Dark Sun setting.\n\tHalflings who prefer to live underground are sometimes called strongheart halflings or stouts. Nomadic halflings, as well as those who live among humans and other tall folk. are sometimes called lightfoot halflings or tallfellows.\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook (2024) p. 193"
